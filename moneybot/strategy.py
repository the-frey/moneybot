class ProposedTrade:
    '''
    ProposedTrades represent possible trades
    that have not yet been executed by a `MarketAdapter`.
    They parlay data between the Strategy and the MarketAdapter.

    Specifically, Strategies use a method `propose_trades()` to
    return a list of ProposedTrades on each trading step. Using a
    high-level API, a Strategy can propose a plausible trade.
    The MarketAdapter then decides if this ProposedTrade trade is legal
    and, if it is, attempts to execute it at the best possible price.
